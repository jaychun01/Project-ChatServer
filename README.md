# Chat Server
## Purpose
This project is one of the project for practicing socket networking and synchronized thread by making server-client chatting program. This java project is to build server. Also, I used JavaFX to create UI. It was better to create UI than swing component, but coupling of classes is more complicated. I refered several blog to complete project.
